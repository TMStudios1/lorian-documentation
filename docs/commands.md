# Command Reference

This is the command reference for Lorian  You can find more elaborative information here on each of the commands currently implemented.

!!! note
    Discord now requires all commands to be used with slash commands. You must use /command in the guild.

!!! tip
    If you have a need for any further info, you can send the message /help <command\> to the bot to get info about the command.

Another thing to note is that some commands will have an empty `Usage` field on this page. This means that the command takes no arguments and is accepted as such.

Usage with <> are required, [] are optional.
