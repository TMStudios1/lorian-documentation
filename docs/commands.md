#Command Reference
This is the command reference for Lorian Version 1.0 You can find more elaborative information here on each of the commands currently implemented.

!!! note 
    If you are using Lorian on your server, and not self hosting, the default prefix is `??`. (prefix may change at anytime, we will update, and let server owners know if it dose.)

!!! tip
    If you have a need for any further info, you can send the message {prefix}help <command> to the bot to get info about the command.

Another thing to note is that some commands will have an empty `Usage` field on this page. This means that the command takes no arguments and is accepted as such.

Usage with <> are required, [] are optional.
